# ü§ñ Obstacle Detection Robot Car

This is a simple Arduino-based robot car that detects obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor and automatically avoids them. The project uses an Arduino UNO, L298N motor driver, ultrasonic distance sensor (HC-SR04), servo motor, and four DC motors for movement.

# ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) mounted on a servo motor scans the environment.

The Arduino reads distance measurements and checks for obstacles.

If an obstacle is detected within a set range:

The car stops.

The servo rotates the ultrasonic sensor to left and right to scan for open paths.

The car turns in the direction with the most clearance.

The L298N motor driver controls the direction and speed of the motors based on the Arduino's instructions.
